Assignment 6: Agile User Stories, Backlog, and Sprint Planning for Weather Tracking System


1. User Story Creation

 | Story ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| US-001 | As a user, I want to view real-time weather updates so that I can plan my day accordingly. | Weather updates load within 2 seconds. | High |
| US-002 | As an emergency responder, I want to receive severe weather alerts so that I can take immediate action. | Alerts are delivered within 5 seconds. | High |
| US-003 | As a user, I want to configure weather notifications based on my location so that I receive relevant updates. | Users can save notification preferences successfully. | Medium |
| US-004 | As a meteorologist, I want to analyze historical weather data so that I can identify patterns. | Data retrieval is accurate and under 1 second. | Medium |
| US-005 | As a system administrator, I want to monitor system performance so that I can ensure uptime and reliability. | System logs and monitoring tools display real-time status. | High |
| US-006 | As a developer, I want to access weather data through an API so that I can integrate it into other applications. | API provides responses within 500ms. | High |
| US-007 | As a user, I want to submit weather reports so that I can contribute to data accuracy. | Reports successfully stored and verified. | Medium |
| US-008 | As a government agency, I want secure access to weather data so that I can comply with regulations. | User authentication follows security protocols. | High |


2. Product Backlog

| Story ID | User Story | Priority (MoSCoW) | Effort Estimate | Dependencies |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| US-001 | View real-time weather updates | Must-have | 3 | None |
| US-002 | Receive severe weather alerts | Must-have | 3 | None |
| US-003 | Configure weather notifications | Should-have | 2 | US-001 |
| US-004 | Analyze historical weather data | Should-have | 3 | None |
| US-005 | Monitor system performance | Must-have | 4 | None |
| US-006 | Provide weather data API access | Must-have | 5 | US-001 |
| US-007 | Submit weather reports | Could-have | 2 | None |
| US-008 | Secure access to weather data | Must-have | 4 | None |

3. Sprint Planning

   Sprint Goal: Implement core weather update, alert functionality, and basic API access.

| Task ID | Task Description | Assigned To | Estimated Hours | Status |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| T-001 | Develop weather API integration | Dev Team | 8 | To Do |
| T-002 | Implement alert system | Dev Team | 6 | To Do |
| T-003 | Create UI for weather updates | UI Team | 5 | To Do |
| T-004 | Implement system monitoring tools | DevOps Team | 7 | To Do |
| T-005 | Ensure API security compliance | Security Team | 6 | To Do |

5. Reflection

   Challenges Faced:

Prioritization: Determining which features should be included in the first sprint.
Effort Estimation: Predicting development time for critical features while ensuring quality.
Agile Transition: Moving from a structured waterfall requirement approach to a flexible Agile methodology.
Stakeholder Alignment: Ensuring that critical features align with end-user and regulatory needs.
