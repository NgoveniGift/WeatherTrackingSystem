# System Requirements Document (SRD) for Weather Tracking System

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Project Overview
The Weather Tracking System is a real-time application developed in Rust to provide accurate weather updates, forecasts, and alerts. It processes live data from multiple sources and offers insights for general users, meteorologists, and emergency response teams.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Deliver real-time weather tracking with minimal latency.
- Provide an intuitive interface for users to access weather forecasts and alerts.
- Ensure system scalability, security, and reliability.

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis
| Stakeholder  | Role | Key Concerns | Pain Points | Success Metrics |
|-------------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Meteorologists** | Provide weather data and forecasts | Accuracy of weather predictions | Delays in updating real-time data | 95% accuracy in predictions |
| **System Administrators** | Maintain and deploy the system | System uptime and security | Complex deployment processes | 99.9% system uptime |
| **Developers** | Develop and enhance system features | Code maintainability and efficiency | Debugging real-time processing issues | 80% faster bug resolution |
| **End Users (General Public)** | Access real-time weather updates | Fast and reliable data access | Slow or outdated weather reports | Response time < 2 seconds |
| **Emergency Response Teams** | Use alerts for disaster response | Timely and precise alerts | Inconsistent alert notifications | Alerts delivered within 5 seconds |
| **Government Agencies** | Utilize weather insights for policy | Regulatory compliance | Data privacy concerns | Full adherence to data security regulations |

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Core Functionalities
1. **Real-Time Data Processing:** The system shall fetch and process weather data from multiple external sources every 30 seconds.
2. **Weather Forecast Display:** The system shall provide users with temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation forecasts.
3. **Severe Weather Alerts:** The system shall issue automated alerts for extreme weather conditions, with a response time under 5 seconds.
4. **User Preferences:** Users shall be able to set location-based weather notifications.
5. **Historical Data Storage:** The system shall store past weather data for trend analysis and retrieval.
6. **API for Third-Party Integrations:** The system shall expose an API for external applications to access weather data.
7. **Interactive Web Interface:** A responsive web interface shall allow users to view and interact with weather reports.
8. **User Reports:** Users shall be able to submit weather anomaly reports.
9. **Multi-Language Support:** The system shall support multiple languages for a global audience.
10. **Authentication and Authorization:** Registered users shall have access to advanced features such as personalized notifications.
