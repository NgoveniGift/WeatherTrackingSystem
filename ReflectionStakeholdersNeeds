Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs


1. Trade-offs Between Accuracy and Speed


Challenge: Real-time data processing requires balancing accuracy and speed.

Impact: Ensuring rapid updates while maintaining high prediction accuracy is difficult.

Mitigation: Implementing machine learning models to enhance accuracy without increasing processing time.


2. Balancing Simplicity vs. Feature Set


Challenge: End users prefer a simple UI, but meteorologists need detailed analytics.

Impact: A cluttered interface could make it difficult for general users to navigate.

Mitigation: Implement a dual-interface systemâ€”one for basic users and another for professionals.


3. Scalability vs. Cost


Challenge: High scalability demands require additional infrastructure, increasing costs.

Impact: Managing resources effectively while keeping the system responsive.

Mitigation: Using cloud-based load balancing to scale resources dynamically based on demand.


4. Security vs. Accessibility


Challenge: Strong security features like encryption and authentication can slow down access.

Impact: Users might experience latency or difficulty accessing real-time data.

Mitigation: Implementing efficient encryption techniques and caching mechanisms to optimize speed.


5. Managing Diverse Stakeholder Expectations


Challenge: Different stakeholders have varying expectations (e.g., meteorologists want detailed analytics, while the general public wants quick forecasts).

Impact: Meeting everyone's needs without overwhelming the system.

Mitigation: Prioritizing features based on stakeholder impact and iterating using Agile methodology.
